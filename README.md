<b>[AutoRA](https://pypi.org/project/autora/)</b> (<b>Auto</b>mated <b>R</b>esearch <b>A</b>ssistant) is an open-source framework for 
automating multiple stages of the empirical research process, including model discovery, experimental design, data collection, and documentation for open science. 

AutoRA was initially intended for accelerating research in the behavioral and brain sciences. However, AutoRA is designed as a general framework that enables automation of the research processes in other empirical sciences, such as material science or physics.
