# Examples

This section provides a set of concrete examples that showcase how to use AutoRA for different purposes. These examples are designed to give you a head start on building your own AutoRA workflow.

Each example walks through a complete workflow, from setting up the experiment to analyzing results, allowing you to see AutoRA in action. Whether you are setting up a basic procedure for automated piloting of experimental data, or a closed-loop study involving iterations between model discovery and experimental design, these examples will guide you through the key steps and provide code snippets to help you along the way.

### How to Use the Examples

- **Follow along:** Each example is self-contained and includes the necessary code and explanations. Simply follow along, and adapt the code to your specific use case.
- **Modify for your needs:** These examples are designed as starting points. You can easily modify parameters, data inputs, or algorithms to fit your research domain.
- **Integrate with existing projects:** Use these examples as a template to integrate AutoRA with your ongoing research projects.

For a detailed overview of AutoRA's features, please refer to the tutorials [main documentation](https://autoresearch.github.io/autora/tutorials/).

Let's dive into the first example to see how you can get started with AutoRA in your experiments.
