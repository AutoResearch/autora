# Automated Research Assistant

<b>[AutoRA](https://pypi.org/project/autora/)</b> (<b>Auto</b>mated <b>R</b>esearch <b>A</b>ssistant) is an open-source framework for 
automating multiple stages of the empirical research process, including model discovery, experimental design, data collection, and documentation for open science.

![Autonomous Empirical Research Paradigm](img/overview.png)

AutoRA implements the <b>Autonomous Empirical Research Paradigm</b>, which involves a dynamic interplay
between two artificial agents. The first agent, a theorist, is primarily responsible for constructing 
computational models by relying on existing data to link experimental conditions to dependent measures. 
The second agent, an experimentalist, is tasked with designing follow-up
experiments that can refine and validate the models generated by the theorist. Together, these agents
implement an automated scientific discovery process. To enable closed-loop empirical research, AutoRA 
interfaces with platforms for automated data collection, such as Prolific or Amazon Mechanical Turk, 
which enable the efficient acquisition of behavioral data from human participants. Finally, AutoRA 
is designed to support the automated documentation and dissemination of steps in the empirical research process.

AutoRA was initially intended for accelerating research in the behavioral and brain sciences. 
However, AutoRA is designed as a general framework that enables automation of research processes in
other empirical sciences, such as materials science or physics.

## Features

AutoRA consists of different modules that can be used independently or in combination, such as:

- <b>Automated theorists</b> that support the discovery of formal scientific models from data
- <b>Automated experimentalists</b> that support the design of follow-up experiments
- <b>Interfaces for automated data collection</b>, e.g., for behavioral experiments via Prolific or Amazon Mechanical Turk
- <b>Workflow logic</b> for defining interactions between different components of the research process
- <b>Interfaces for automated documentation</b> of the research process

## Usages

AutoRA can be used for a variety of research purposes in empirical sciences, such as psychology, 
neuroscience, economics, physics, or materials science. Usages include:

- <b>Equation discovery</b> from empirical data
- <b>Experimental design</b> for follow-up experiments
- <b>Research documentation and dissemination</b>
- <b>Closed-loop empirical research</b>
- <b>Computational analyses of the scientific process</b> (metascience, computational philosophy of science)

## Motivation

The pace of progress in empirical research is largely dictated by iteration speed â€” that is, for a given amount of resources, the rate at which researchers can cycle between formal theory development and experimentation while ensuring rigorous scientific practice. At present, a major limit to iteration speed stems from the time-intensive, manual nature of the research process. Most stages of this process rely on semi-directed trial and error of humans with years of narrow training. Such a limit impedes science as well as its translation and broader impact. We seek to overcome this bottleneck by developing an open-source platform for the generation, estimation, and empirical testing of scientific models. It is our hope that AutoRA will accelerate scientific discovery while promoting greater transparency and rigor in empirical research.
