# Contribute A Theorist

AutoRA theorists are meant to return scientific models describing the relationship between experimental conditions
and observations. Such models may take the form of a simple linear regression, non-linear equations, causal graphs, 
a more complex neural network, or other models which

- can be identified based on data (and prior knowledge)
- can be used to make novel predictions about observations given experimental conditions.

![Theorist Module](../../img/theorist.png)

All theorists are implemented as `sklearn` regressors. They are fitted based on experimental conditions and respective
observations, and can be used to predict observations for new experimental conditions.

## Repository Setup

We recommend using the [cookiecutter template](https://github.com/AutoResearch/autora-template-cookiecutter) to set up
a repository for your theorist. Alternatively, you use the 
[unguided template](https://github.com/AutoResearch/autora-template). If you are using the cookiecutter template, you can set up your repository using

```shell
cookiecutter https://github.com/AutoResearch/autora-template-cookiecutter
```

Make sure to select the `theorist` option when prompted. You can skip all other prompts pertaining to other modules 
(e.g., experimentalists) by pressing enter.

## Implementation

Once you've created your repository, you can implement your theorist by editing the `__init__.py` 
file in 
``src/autora/theorist/name_of_your_theorist/``. You may also add additional files to this directory if needed. 
It is important that the `__init__.py` file contains a class called `NameOfYourTheorist` which 
inherits from  
`sklearn.base.BaseEstimator` and implements the following methods:

- `fit(self, conditions, observations)`
- `predict(self, conditions)`

See the [sklearn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/develop.html) for more information on 
how to implement the methods. The following example ``__init__.py`` illustrates the implementation 
of a simple theorist
that fits a polynomial function to the data:

```python 

"""
Example Theorist
"""

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from typing import Union
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator


class ExampleRegressor(BaseEstimator):
    """
    This theorist fits a polynomial function to the data.
    """

    def __init__(self, degree: int = 2):
        self.degree = degree

    def fit(self, conditions: Union[pd.DataFrame, np.ndarray],
            observations: Union[pd.DataFrame, np.ndarray]):

        # fit polynomial function: observations ~ conditions 
        self.coeff = np.polyfit(conditions, observations, deg = 2)
        self.polynomial = np.poly1d(self.coeff)
        pass

    def predict(self, conditions):
            
        return self.polynomial(conditions)
```

Note, however, that it is best practice to make sure the conditions are compatible with the `polyfit`. In this case, we will make sure to add some checks:

```python 

"""
Example Theorist
"""

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from typing import Union
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator


class ExampleRegressor(BaseEstimator):
    """
    This theorist fits a polynomial function to the data.
    """

    def __init__(self, degree: int = 2):
        self.degree = degree

    def fit(self, conditions: Union[pd.DataFrame, np.ndarray],
            observations: Union[pd.DataFrame, np.ndarray]):
    
        # polyfit expects a 1D array, convert pandas data frame to 1D vector
        if isinstance(conditions, pd.DataFrame):
          conditions = conditions.squeeze()
        
        # polyfit expects a 1D array, flatten nd array
        if isinstance(conditions, np.ndarray) and conditions.ndim > 1:
            conditions = conditions.flatten()

        # fit polynomial function: observations ~ conditions 
        self.coeff = np.polyfit(conditions, observations, deg = 2)
        self.polynomial = np.poly1d(self.coeff)
        pass

    def predict(self, conditions):
        
        # polyfit expects a 1D array, convert pandas data frame to 1D vector
        if isinstance(conditions, pd.DataFrame):
          conditions = conditions.squeeze()
        
        # polyfit expects a 1D array, flatten nd array
        if isinstance(conditions, np.ndarray) and conditions.ndim > 1:
            conditions = conditions.flatten()
            
        return self.polynomial(conditions)
```
