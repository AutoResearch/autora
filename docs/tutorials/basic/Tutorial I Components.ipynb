    "The AutoRA ecosystem is a comprehensive collection of packages that together establish a framework for closed-loop empirical research.

It provides functionalities for automating workflows in empirical research and includes vetted modules with minimal dependencies.\n",

Our main focus will be on two experimentalists: ``experimentalist-falsification`` and ``experimentalist-novelty``, along with a Bayesian Machine Scientist (BMS) implemented in the ``theorist-bms`` package.

    "\n",
    "``autora`` provides support for experiment runners, which serve as interfaces for conducting both real-world and synthetic experiments. An experiment runner typically accepts experiment conditions as input (e.g., a 2-dimensional numpy array with columns representing different independent variables) and produces collected observations as output (e.g., a 2-dimensional numpy array with columns representing different dependent variables). These experiment runners can be combined with other ``autora`` components to facilitate closed-loop scientific discovery.\n",

These runners often require external components such as databases to store collected observations or servers to host the experiments. You may refer to the respective tutorials for these interfaces on how to set up all required components.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Synthetic experiments** are conducted on synthetic experiment runners, which are functions that take experimental conditions as input and generate simulated observations as output.
