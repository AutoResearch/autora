| State              | Object representing data from an experiment, like the conditions, observed experiment data and models. The State also includes rules on how to update those data if new data are provided using the "Delta mechanism". | Core                                            |
| Delta              | An object with new data that can be added to a State, returning a new State which includes the new data.                                                                                                               | Core                                            |

| Experimentalist    | A component that outputs new conditions, which are intended to yield novel observations.                                                                                                                               | Experimentalists                                |
| Theorist           | A component that takes in the full collection of conditions and observations and outputs models that link the two.                                                                                                     | Theorists                                       |
