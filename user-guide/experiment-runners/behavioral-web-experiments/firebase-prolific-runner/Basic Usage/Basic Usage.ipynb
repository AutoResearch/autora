    "# Recruitment Via Prolific\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up a random dot motion (RDK) experiment, sample experimental conditions, collect data via the recruitment platform [Prolific](https://www.prolific.com/) and use linear regression to analyse the data. We will use the following components:\n",

    "- theorist: linear regression\n",
    "- experiment-runner: serving the experiment via Firebase and recruiting participants via Prolific\n",
    "- experimentalist: random sampling\n",

    "## Prerequisites\n",

For example include a consent page.\n",
