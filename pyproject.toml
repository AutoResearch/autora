description = "Autonomous Research Assistant (AutoRA) is a framework for automating steps of the empirical research process. This framework implements tools for autonomously and iteratively generating 1) new theories to describe real-world data, and 2) experiments to invalidate those theories and seed a new cycle of theory-making. The experiments will be run online via crowd-sourcing platforms (MTurk, Prolific)."
