    Chooses a random operation, ignoring any data which already exist.

    Interpretation: A mercurial PI with good technique but poor planning, who doesn't remember what
    they did last.

    Examples:
        We simulate a productive executor_collection using a simple dict
        >>> executor_collection_ = dict(
        ...     experimentalist = "experimentalist",
        ...     experiment_runner = "experiment_runner",

        >>> seed(42)

        Now we can begin to see which operations are returned by the planner. The first (for this
        seed) is the theorist. (The first argument is provided for compatibility with the
        protocol, but is ignored.)
