    Examples:
        We initialize a new list to run our planner on:
        >>> history = []

        We simulate a productive executor_collection using a SimpleNamespace
        >>> from types import SimpleNamespace

        ...     experiment_runner = "experiment_runner",
        ...     theorist = "theorist",
        ... )

        Based on the results available in the state, we can get the next kind of executor we need.
        When we have no results of any kind, we get an experimentalist:
        >>> last_result_kind_planner(history, executor_collection)
        'experimentalist'

        ... or if we had produced conditions, then we could run an experiment

        >>> last_result_kind_planner(history, executor_collection)
        'theorist'

        ... or if we last produced a theory, then we could now run the experimentalist:

    Chooses a random operation, ignoring any data which already exist.

    Interpretation: A mercurial PI with good technique but poor planning, who doesn't remember what
    they did last.

    Examples:
        We simulate a productive executor_collection using a SimpleNamespace

        For reproducibility, we seed the random number generator consistently:
        >>> from random import seed
        >>> seed(42)

        Now we can begin to see which operations are returned by the planner. The first (for this
        seed) is the theorist. (The first argument is provided for compatibility with the
        protocol, but is ignored.)
        >>> random_operation_planner([], executor_collection)
